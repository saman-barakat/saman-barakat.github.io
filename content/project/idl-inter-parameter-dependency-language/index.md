Inter-Parameter Dependency Language (IDL) is a textual domain-specific language for the specification of dependencies among input parameters in web APIs. IDL is designed to express the seven types of inter-parameter dependencies identified on real-world APIs, including (**Requires**, **Or**, **OnlyOne**, **AllOrNone**, **ZeroOrOne**, **Arithmetic/Relational**, **Complex**).
