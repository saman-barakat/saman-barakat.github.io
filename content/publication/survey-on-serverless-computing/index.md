abstract: Serverless computing has gained importance over the last decade as an
  exciting new field, owing to its large influence in reducing costs, decreasing
  latency, improving scalability, and eliminating server-side management, to
  name a few. However, to date there is a lack of in-depth survey that would
  help developers and researchers better understand the significance of
  serverless computing in different contexts. Thus, it is essential to present
  research evidence that has been published in this area. In this systematic
  survey, 275 research papers that examined serverless computing from well-known
  literature databases were extensively reviewed to extract useful data. Then,
  the obtained data were analyzed to answer several research questions regarding
  state-of-the-art contributions of serverless computing, its concepts, its
  platforms, its usage, etc. We moreover discuss the challenges that serverless
  computing faces nowadays and how future research could enable its
  implementation and usage.
