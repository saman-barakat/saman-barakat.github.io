abstract: >-
  The generation of code templates from REST API specifications is a common
  practice in industry. However, existing tools neglects the dependencies among
  input parameters (so called inter-parameter dependencies), extremelly common
  in practice and usually described in natural language. As a result, developers
  are responsible for implementing the corresponding validation logic manually,
  a tedious and errorprone process. In this paper, we present an approach for
  the automated generation of code for inter-parameter dependencies specified
  using the IDL4OAS extension. As a proof of concept, we present an extension of
  the popular openapi-generator tool ecosystem, automating the generation of
  Java and Python code for the management of inter-parameter

  dependencies in both, servers and clients. Preliminary results show the effectiveness of the approach in accelerating the development of APIs while making them potentially more reliable.
