abstract: Monolithic applications have some drawbacks and issues. In particular,
  when new features are added to the monolithic applications the code bases
  become bigger. With Microservices such issues can be avoided. Microservices
  are software architecture that consists of small, distributed services that
  work together. It has many advantages such as simplicity, independent service
  scalability, using different technologies and simplicity in deployment, but
  requires knowledge in distributed systems. In this research, an existing
  microservice-based application has been monitored and analyzed. The Kieker
  framework has been used for monitoring the application performance and the
  Kieker trace analysis tools have been used to analyze the application
