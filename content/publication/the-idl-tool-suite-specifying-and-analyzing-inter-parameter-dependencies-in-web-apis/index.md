abstract: Web APIs may include inter-parameter dependencies that limit how input
  parameters can be combined to call services correctly. These dependencies are
  extremely common, appearing in 4 out of every 5 APIs. This paper presents the
  IDL tool suite, a set of software tools for managing inter-parameter
  dependencies in web APIs. The suite includes a specification language (IDL),
  an OpenAPI Specification extension (IDL4OAS), an analysis engine
  (IDLReasoner), a web API, a playground, an AI chatbot, and a website. We also
  highlight several contributions by different groups of authors where the IDL
  tool suite has proven useful in the domains of automated testing, code
  generation, and API gateways. To date, the IDL tool suite has contributed to
  the detection of more than 200 bugs in industrial APIs, including GitHub,
  Spotify, and YouTube, among others. Also, IDL has been used to boost automated
  code generation, generating up to 10 times more code than state-of-the-art
  generators for web APIs.
