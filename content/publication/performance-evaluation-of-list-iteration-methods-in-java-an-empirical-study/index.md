  Introduction: Lists are used in various software applications including web
  applications, desktop applications, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications
  to store different types of items (e.g. country name, product model, and
  device category). Users can select one or more of these items to perform
  specific tasks such as filling forms, ordering products, reading device data,
  etc. In some software applications, lists store a huge number of items to be
  iterated over in order to know what users have selected. From a software
  development perspective, there are a number of methods to iterate over list
  items. Materials and Methods: In this paper, five list iteration methods:
  Classic For, Enhanced For, Iterator, List Iterator, and For Each have been
  compared experimentally with each

  other with regard to their performance (execution time required to iterate over list items). Thus, a number of experimental test scenarios have been conducted to obtain the comparison results. Results and Discussion: The experimental results of this study have been presented in Table 4. Conclusions: Overall performance evaluation showed that Iterator and List Iterator methods outperformed other list iteration methods in all test scenarios. However, List Iterator outperformed Iterator when the list size was small. On the other hand, Iterator outperformed List Iterator when the list size

  was large.
