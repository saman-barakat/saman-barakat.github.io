abstract: "Introduction: Lists are used in various software applications
  including web applications, desktop applications, and Internet of Things (IoT)
  applications to store different types of items (e.g. country name, product
  model, and device category). Users can select one or more of these items to
  perform specific tasks such as filling forms, ordering products, reading
  device data, etc. In some software applications, lists store a huge number of
  items to be iterated over in order to know what users have selected. From a
  software development perspective, there are a number of methods to iterate
  over list items. Materials and Methods: In this paper, five list iteration
  methods: Classic For, Enhanced For, Iterator, List Iterator, and For Each have
  been compared experimentally with each other with regard to their performance
  (execution time required to iterate over list items). Thus, a number of
  experimental test scenarios have been conducted to obtain the comparison
  results. Results and Discussion: The experimental results of this study have
  been presented in Table 4. Conclusions: Overall performance evaluation showed
  that Iterator and List Iterator methods outperformed other list iteration
  methods in all test scenarios. However, List Iterator outperformed Iterator
  when the list size was small. On the other hand, Iterator outperformed List
  Iterator when the list size was large."
