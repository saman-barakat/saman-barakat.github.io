  Security issues can be a barrier to make successful online businesses because
  the Internet can

  make critical information vulnerable. Non-repudiation is a security feature that is related to integrity

  and authenticity. Providing non-repudiation for online communication is a key factor to achieve a

  successful electronic business. Non-repudiation should ensure that each involvement in an online

  interaction cannot be denied. Besides, non-repudiation, fairness between the parties also plays an important

  role to achieve successful electronic businesses. One solution used to achieve fair non-repudiation services is

  by using a trusted third party (TTP) that implements fair non-repudiation protocols. This project uses

  work that has been done by Cook et al in 2006 as a starting point, which was a non-repudiation service

  project that uses SOAP web service technology. However, this project aims to implement non-repudiation

  services using Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture style principles in order to obtain

  significant advantages that REST technology provides such as scalability and simplicity.
