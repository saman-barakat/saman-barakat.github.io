  Security issues can be a barrier to make successful online businesses because
  the Internet can make critical information vulnerable. Non-repudiation is a
  security feature that is related to integrity and authenticity. Providing
  non-repudiation for online communication is a key factor to achieve a
  successful electronic business. Non-repudiation should ensure that each
  involvement in an online interaction cannot be denied. Besides,
  non-repudiation, fairness between the parties also plays an important

  role to achieve successful electronic businesses. One solution used to achieve fair non-repudiation services is by using a trusted third party (TTP) that implements fair non-repudiation protocols. This project uses work that has been done by Cook et al in 2006 as a starting point, which was a non-repudiation service project that uses SOAP web service technology. However, this project aims to implement non-repudiation services using Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture style principles in order to obtain significant advantages that REST technology provides such as scalability and simplicity.
