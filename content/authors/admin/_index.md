My name is Saman Barakat, and I have recently completed a Ph.D. in Software Engineering at the University of Seville. My doctoral research focused on automated support for managing inter-parameter dependencies in web APIs.

My current research interest lies in the application of Large Language Models for Mining Software Repositories (LLM4MSR). I am particularly interested in how LLMs can be used to analyze and generate software-related information, enabling new ways to understand, maintain, and automate software systems. I am eager to explore this area further and contribute to ongoing research at the intersection of language models and software engineering.
