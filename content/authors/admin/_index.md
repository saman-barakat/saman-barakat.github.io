I am a Ph.D. student and predoctoral researcher at the SCORE Lab, University of Seville. I hold an MSc in Advanced Computer Science from Newcastle University, UK. My research focuses on **inter-parameter dependencies in web APIs**, aiming to extend and enhance the [IDL Tool Suite](http://idl.us.es). My work covers a variety of applications, such as **automated code generation** and **API gateways**, which contribute to innovative web API development and integration solutions.
