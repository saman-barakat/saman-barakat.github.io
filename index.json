However, existing tools neglects the dependencies among input parameters (so called inter-parameter dependencies), extremelly common in practice and usually described in natural language. As a result, developers are responsible for implementing the corresponding validation logic manually, a tedious and errorprone process. In this paper, we present an approach for the automated generation of code for inter-parameter dependencies specified using the IDL4OAS extension. As a proof of concept, we present an extension of the popular openapi-generator tool ecosystem, automating the generation of Java and Python code for the management of inter-parameter\ndependencies in both, servers and clients. Preliminary results show the effectiveness of the approach in accelerating the development of APIs while making them potentially more reliable.","tags":null,"title":"Automated Code Generation for Inter-parameter Dependencies in REST APIs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hassan B.

However, to date there is a lack of in-depth survey that would help developers and researchers better understand the significance of serverless computing in different contexts. Thus, it is essential to present research evidence that has been published in this area. In this systematic survey, 275 research papers that examined serverless computing from well-known literature databases were extensively reviewed to extract useful data. Then, the obtained data were analyzed to answer several research questions regarding state-of-the-art contributions of serverless computing, its concepts, its platforms, its usage, etc. We moreover discuss the challenges that serverless computing faces nowadays and how future research could enable its implementation and usage.","tags":null,"title":"Survey on serverless computing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sarhan S Dawood","SamanBarakat"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1602673807,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602673807,"objectID":"d2c2f90605e97bbe5b17d9bbe7d88f8e","permalink":"https://saman-barakat.github.io/publication/empirical-performance-evaluation-of-knuth-morris-pratt-and-boyer-moore-string-matching-algorithms/","publishdate":"2020-10-14T11:10:07.094Z","relpermalink":"/publication/empirical-performance-evaluation-of-knuth-morris-pratt-and-boyer-moore-string-matching-algorithms/","section":"publication","summary":"Many algorithms have been proposed for string matching in order to find a specific pattern in a given text.

Users can select one or more of these items to perform specific tasks such as filling forms, ordering products, reading device data, etc. In some software applications, lists store a huge number of items to be iterated over in order to know what users have selected. From a software development perspective, there are a number of methods to iterate over list items. Materials and Methods: In this paper, five list iteration methods: Classic For, Enhanced For, Iterator, List Iterator, and For Each have been compared experimentally with each other with regard to their performance (execution time required to iterate over list items). Thus, a number of experimental test scenarios have been conducted to obtain the comparison results. Results and Discussion: The experimental results of this study have been presented in Table 4. Conclusions: Overall performance evaluation showed that Iterator and List Iterator methods outperformed other list iteration methods in all test scenarios. However, List Iterator outperformed Iterator when the list size was small. On the other hand, Iterator outperformed List Iterator when the list size was large.","tags":null,"title":"Performance evaluation of list iteration methods in Java: an empirical study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Saman Barakat"],"categories":["publications"],"content":"","date":1494759912,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1494759912,"objectID":"b35e3680c37cd4b9608a20057ed96a9b","permalink":"https://saman-barakat.github.io/publication/monitoring-and-analysis-of-microservices-performance/","publishdate":"2017-05-14T11:05:12.062Z","relpermalink":"/publication/monitoring-and-analysis-of-microservices-performance/","section":"publication","summary":"Monolithic applications have some drawbacks and issues.

Non-repudiation is a security feature that is related to integrity and authenticity. Providing non-repudiation for online communication is a key factor to achieve a successful electronic business. Non-repudiation should ensure that each involvement in an online interaction cannot be denied. Besides, non-repudiation, fairness between the parties also plays an important\nrole to achieve successful electronic businesses. One solution used to achieve fair non-repudiation services is by using a trusted third party (TTP) that implements fair non-repudiation protocols. This project uses work that has been done by Cook et al in 2006 as a starting point, which was a non-repudiation service project that uses SOAP web service technology.
