However, to date there is a lack of in-depth survey that would help developers and researchers better understand the significance of serverless computing in different contexts. Thus, it is essential to present research evidence that has been published in this area. In this systematic survey, 275 research papers that examined serverless computing from well-known literature databases were extensively reviewed to extract useful data. Then, the obtained data were analyzed to answer several research questions regarding state-of-the-art contributions of serverless computing, its concepts, its platforms, its usage, etc. We moreover discuss the challenges that serverless computing faces nowadays and how future research could enable its implementation and usage.","tags":null,"title":"Survey on serverless computing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sarhan S Dawood","SamanBarakat"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1602673807,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602673807,"objectID":"d2c2f90605e97bbe5b17d9bbe7d88f8e","permalink":"https://saman-barakat.github.io/publication/empirical-performance-evaluation-of-knuth-morris-pratt-and-boyer-moore-string-matching-algorithms/","publishdate":"2020-10-14T11:10:07.094Z","relpermalink":"/publication/empirical-performance-evaluation-of-knuth-morris-pratt-and-boyer-moore-string-matching-algorithms/","section":"publication","summary":"Many algorithms have been proposed for string matching in order to find a specific pattern in a given text.

Users can select one or more of these items to perform specific tasks such as filling forms, ordering products, reading device data, etc. In some software applications, lists store a huge number of items to be iterated over in order to know what users have selected. From a software development perspective, there are a number of methods to iterate over list items. Materials and Methods: In this paper, five list iteration methods: Classic For, Enhanced For, Iterator, List Iterator, and For Each have been compared experimentally with each other with regard to their performance (execution time required to iterate over list items). Thus, a number of experimental test scenarios have been conducted to obtain the comparison results. Results and Discussion: The experimental results of this study have been presented in Table 4. Conclusions: Overall performance evaluation showed that Iterator and List Iterator methods outperformed other list iteration methods in all test scenarios. However, List Iterator outperformed Iterator when the list size was small. On the other hand, Iterator outperformed List Iterator when the list size was large.","tags":null,"title":"Performance evaluation of list iteration methods in Java: an empirical study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Saman Barakat"],"categories":["publications"],"content":"","date":1494759912,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1494759912,"objectID":"b35e3680c37cd4b9608a20057ed96a9b","permalink":"https://saman-barakat.github.io/publication/monitoring-and-analysis-of-microservices-performance/","publishdate":"2017-05-14T11:05:12.062Z","relpermalink":"/publication/monitoring-and-analysis-of-microservices-performance/","section":"publication","summary":"Monolithic applications have some drawbacks and issues. In particular, when new features are added to the monolithic applications the code bases become bigger. With Microservices such issues can be avoided. Microservices are software architecture that consists of small, distributed services that work together. It has many advantages such as simplicity, independent service scalability, using different technologies and simplicity in deployment, but requires knowledge in distributed systems.

Non-repudiation is a security feature that is related to integrity and authenticity. Providing non-repudiation for online communication is a key factor to achieve a successful electronic business. Non-repudiation should ensure that each involvement in an online interaction cannot be denied. Besides, non-repudiation, fairness between the parties also plays an important\nrole to achieve successful electronic businesses. One solution used to achieve fair non-repudiation services is by using a trusted third party (TTP) that implements fair non-repudiation protocols. This project uses work that has been done by Cook et al in 2006 as a starting point, which was a non-repudiation service project that uses SOAP web service technology. However, this project aims to implement non-repudiation services using Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture style principles in order to obtain significant advantages that REST technology provides such as scalability and simplicity.
